# Purple Team Gameplay

## Offensive Cybersecurity Attacks 
### Cyber attacks are most often infiltrating a system in order to gain information without being caught or to disrupt order in/around the system.
### This is inherently active, and therefore should instigate an interaction between player and adversary.

#### DOS - Flood with fake Traffic.
- Mechanic Ideas: obstruct screen, slow down screen, flood mini map with fake people, timed/runs out unless countered

#### Malware - Corrupt recipient with a virus.
- Mechanic Ideas: reverse controls, timed/runs out unless countered

#### Social Engineering - Send question designed to get recipient to divulge info
- Mechanic Ideas:

#### Phishing - Send fake option to trick recipient into clicking, almost like a pop up ad
- Mechanic Ideas: if clicked, the recipient is stunned for a short time



## Defensive Cybersecurity Precautions 
### Cyber defense is most often placing precautions before an attack or restoring control after an attack. 
### It is not as much actively stopping attacks, therefore defensive cyber mechanics should be either passive or in response.

#### Firewall/Reboot - stops Dos attack (if thrown up in time?)
- Mechanic Ideas: if equipped, blocks dos attack from effecting


#### Antivirus - attacks and removes the virus from the recipient
- Mechanic Ideas: if equipped, blocks a certain amount of Malware attacks from effecting

#### No Counter/Reflexes - recipient needs to be able to recognize attack and not fall for it
- Mechanic Ideas:



## Gameplay Loop 1

### King of the Hill
#### Objective-based match where being in the hill alone or with allies gains points.
- Being in the hill with an adversary makes the hill contested and gains nobody points.
After a certain short amount of time, the hill will move to another location.
When one player/team reaches a certain number of points, they will win and the game will end.
After a certain amount of time, if no player/team reaches the specified number of points, the game ends in a draw.
