## Gameplay Loop 1

### King of the Hill
#### Objective-based match where being in the hill alone or with allies gains points.
- Being in the hill with an adversary makes the hill contested and gains nobody points.
After a certain short amount of time, the hill will move to another location.
When one player/team reaches a certain number of points, they will win and the game will end.
After a certain amount of time, if no player/team reaches the specified number of points, the game ends in a draw.
